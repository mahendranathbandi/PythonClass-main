#occure anything in differnt forms is the polymorphism.
#Polymorphism is a very important concept in programming.
# It refers to the use of a single type entity (method, operator or object) to represent different types in different scenarios.


#poly in addition operation

# "+" is used to perform addition operations on integrers where as in strings it is to concatenation.

print(2+3)
print("hell0"+"python")

# Product two numbers
print(3 * 4)

# Repeat the String
print("Geeks" * 4)


# function polymorphism in python.
# len() function can work with different data types in python
print(len("stringstring"))
print(len([1,35,2,5,5,2]))
print(len({'name':"python",'name1':"python2",'name3':"python3"}))

#class polymorphism
#polymorphism will allows differnt class have methods with same name .
