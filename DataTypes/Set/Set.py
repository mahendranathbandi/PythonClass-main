#set is data type
# set is mutable
# set is unorder collection and every element in set is  unique no duplicate are allowed.

# set should has immutable values
# set does not allow list as it has mutable
# set can not has sets , dictionary, list
# set does not allow indexing
# for loop works
# membership opertaor
