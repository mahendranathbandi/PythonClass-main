# strings are immutable
# list mutable
#tuple immutable
# dic is mutable but keys are immutble  and values are mutable

#In list,tuple,string we give index and gets value
#In dictionary we give Key and gets value

# iteration through list , typle, string we use for loop.
# list , tuple, strings iterable objects.


# list has only pop method, we give index in list
# dictinary has pop and popitem, we give key in dict for pop method only and nothing for popitem.
